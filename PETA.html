            <h2>The film is realistic and informative because it depicts how poor
            the country's healthcare system is and how difficult it is to obtain 
            healthcare assistance, particularly for the elderly. Aside from these, the film
            demonstrates how people can do less as they age.</h2>

            <h1>SUMMARY</h1><br>
            <p>Pan de Salawal is set in a neighborhood where nearly everyone has a health issue.
               Salvador<i>(Bodjie Pascua)</i> or Sal, a pandesal baker with a chronic renal problem, 
               wishes to end his life by running up to an approaching train in a small town near the Manila Railroad.
               A barber with hand tremors, a Carinosa dancer paralyzed by
               a stroke, and a meat vendor with a tumor in his breast were among his neighbors. <br><br>

               Their illnesses and disabilities are accompanied by unfulfilled expectations<br>and dreams until they are miraculously cured by inflicting pain on them by <br>a 7-year-old girl named Aguy <i>(ouch in Bisaya)</i>. Aguy<i>(Miel Espinosa)</i> formed<br>an unlikely friendship with Sal, the only person Aguy could not heal. <br><br>
               Given that she was inseparable from Sal, Aguy realized that the most painful thing she could do for Sal was also the most painful thing she could do for herself: heal him. Finally, the film's theme is the irony of pain, in which people seek comfort from those who have hurt them.</p><br>

            <h1>ANALYSIS</h1><br>
            <p>The film began slowly and uneventfully, but the build-up to Sal and Aguy's meeting was well worth the wait. Despite these flaws, there are more positive than negative aspects to consider in the film, such as the masterful delivery of playful humor and the sense of innocent and magical wonder. 
            Aguy chose to leave in order to avoid seeing Sal suffer from pain that couldn't be cured away despite all the punches and pinches. Similarly to this scene, sentimentality and realism are evident in the film--each character's performance is the film's main strength because of how it captures the viewers' emotions.</p><br>

            <h1>CONCLUSION</h1><br>
            <p>In comparison to reality, the film depicts both internal and external conflicts that everyone will or ought to face. With an excellent cast, the film successfully delivers a heartwarming comedy-drama to the audience. The film depicts how healing can be a painful process, but that allowing oneself to go through the pain and become vulnerable can result in change and renewal. likewise how people can heal anyone but their loved ones. Che Espiritu's film serves as a reminder to show kindness and a spark of magic even to strangers. This film is highly recommended by the authors of this review if you want to laugh and cry at the same time.</p><br>
